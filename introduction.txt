I am a passionate learner with a strong interest in technology, education, and creative problem-solving.

I enjoy learning new skills, working on meaningful projects, and using technology to improve lives, especially in underserved communities.  
I am learning GitHub because I want to understand how developers work together to build projects and manage code. My goal is to become proficient in version control, collaborate effectively with others, and create a strong portfolio of my work. By learning GitHub, I hope to contribute to educational projects, develop useful tools, and grow my skills as a future tech-savvy entrepreneuer.
